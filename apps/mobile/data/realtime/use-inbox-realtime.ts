/**
 * Inbox realtime — Layer 3 of the realtime stack.
 *
 * Two subscription groups:
 *
 * 1. `inbox:*` events → invalidate the inbox list AND the cross-workspace
 *    unread summary that backs the tab badge (the summary lives under its
 *    own account-level key, so the list invalidation does not reach it).
 *    inbox payloads are small and (apart from inbox:new) rare, so refetching
 *    is cheaper than maintaining per-event patchers. Multi-device parity:
 *    subscribing to inbox:read / inbox:archived means a read/archive on web
 *    reaches mobile within the next WS frame (web's use-realtime-sync
 *    deliberately DOESN'T subscribe to those, but mobile's stricter freshness
 *    wins for multi-device users).
 *
 * 2. `issue:*` events → patch the inbox cache directly via the dedicated
 *    updaters (inbox-ws-updaters.ts). Required because:
 *      - `issue:updated` with a new status must flip the inbox row's
 *        StatusIcon inline — otherwise the row keeps showing stale status.
 *      - `issue:deleted` must strip every inbox item pointing at that
 *        issue, otherwise tapping the orphan row 404s on issue/[id].
 *    Web does the same in `packages/core/inbox/ws-updaters.ts`.
 *
 * Reconnect: invalidate the list (we may have missed events while down;
 * no replay buffer in v1).
