/**
 * Workspace-level mention picker route — formSheet, opened from any
 * composer that has an `@` button (currently the issue-comment composer
 * and the chat composer).
 *
 * `?mode=` controls which sections render:
 *   - "comment" (default) — @all + People + Agents + Squads + Issues.
 *     The comment composer offers the full surface; mentions notify the
 *     mentioned actor.
 *   - "chat" — Issues only. Chat is user ↔ single agent, so member /
 *     agent / squad / @all mentions are noise (and would generate
 *     unintended notifications). Issues remain useful as "reference this
 *     ticket for the agent's context".
 *
 * Lives at workspace level (not nested under issue/[id]) because the chat
 * tab has no per-session route to nest under; making it workspace-level
 * keeps a single route file serving both contexts.
