# Four-category issue lifecycle (MUL-7240)

## Contract

| Stored category | Fixed built-in statuses | Custom status behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unstarted` | `backlog`, `todo` | Open work; no Backlog parking or promotion rule |
| `started` | `in_progress`, `in_review`, `blocked` | Open work; no review completion, blocked failure, or active-status recovery rule |
| `done` | `done` | Successful terminal lifecycle |
| `closed` | `cancelled` | Cancelled terminal lifecycle |

Done is not an intermediate step toward Closed. In Review and Awaiting Response
belong to Started. A status's label does not grant behavior. Built-ins remain
locked, including name, color, category, archival and deletion. Custom
keys and categories remain immutable; their labels, descriptions and colors may
be edited, and all active statuses can be reordered within their category.
Custom statuses can only be archived after every referencing issue has been
moved elsewhere, including completed/canceled issues. The archive endpoint
checks the count under the same catalog lock used by status writers and returns
409 with `code: issue_status_in_use` and `issue_count` when occupied. Older
clients display the accompanying error message; no new request field is required.
During mixed-server rollout, an old server can still accept the previous
archive behavior until it is replaced. Deploy the backend before relying on
the restriction; no schema migration or automatic issue migration is involved.

Archived statuses no longer create default board/list/swimlane columns. Old
archives with historical issues remain resolvable and can be inspected/moved
out via Settings > Show archived > View issues (an independent, transient exact-status
list). This includes sub-issues and terminal issues without changing saved-view
selection, workspace filters, or All/Members/Agents preferences. Moving issues
does not automatically archive the status; retry archive explicitly once empty.
The archive itself neither moves issues nor emits issue transition events.

The server's `Effective`/SQL `issue_effective_status` functions preserve built-in
identity, map custom Done/Closed to terminal behavior, and leave other custom
keys distinct. Lifecycle grouping uses `Category`, not the effective behavior.
Ordinary creation, assignment, comments, and explicit run requests retain their
existing trigger rules. Merely entering a custom Started status is not an
instruction to start, finish or fail an agent. The built-in platform skill and
new daemon task briefs describe this distinction. This is not a workflow engine;
PR #7990 is subsequent work, not part of this release.

## Migration and release

1. Before deploying, count catalog rows by category and active/archive state;
   identify custom Backlog, In Review and Blocked usages, especially issues in
   active autopilot runs. Also check historical custom keys named `unstarted`,
   `started`, or `closed`: exact-key filters must continue selecting those statuses,
   not interpret their keys as category filters. Tell affected users that those custom statuses will
   no longer park, finish or fail automation. The decision applies to historical
   custom statuses too; no legacy behavior is retained.
2. Apply migration 469 (categories) and 470 (icon), then deploy the matching backend. The catalog rewrite,
   constraints and SQL behavior function change in one atomic statement. It
   preserves every status ID/key/name/color/order/archive marker and every issue
   reference. It does not update issues, replay events, or enqueue tasks.
3. The approximately one-minute mixed-backend window is an accepted maintenance
   window, not a zero-downtime guarantee. Old pods may reject catalog writes in
   that window. Finish replacing them before acceptance testing.
4. Deploy the Web/Desktop/Mobile client changes and update local daemons. New
   skills/prompts take effect in newly prepared task environments; already
   running agents do not have their prompt rewritten. Do not replay or restart
   tasks automatically. Review affected in-flight work and move it to an
   appropriate fixed built-in status only when that action is intended.
5. Verify four stored categories, seven unchanged fixed keys, unchanged row and
   issue-reference counts, custom status CRUD/archive, terminal filtering, independent built-in/custom status
   columns, counts, pagination and drag/create targets, and lack of unintended task enqueues. Check API error rates and
   automation completion/failure paths.

Release policy is fix-forward. Do not roll back application code over the new
schema or restore a second behavior model. If migration fails, its atomic
statement leaves the prior catalog intact: diagnose and apply the corrected
forward migration. If it committed, repair with a new forward migration or
patch. The paired down file deliberately refuses reversal; reapplying the up
statement after an uncertain acknowledgement is idempotent.

Before merging, these migrations were renumbered from 467/468, then 468/469,
to 469/470 to follow main's existing 468 migrations. Main's two distinct 468
filenames are preserved, with an exact-pair exception in the numbering lint;
new collisions remain forbidden. The runner keys its ledger by the full
filename stem, not just the number. A local preview that ran the earlier names
will therefore replay the new names; both up statements are idempotent, and
icon replay preserves saved shapes. Do not rewrite or delete ledger entries.

## Installed-client compatibility

Status keys on issue create/get/update/assign do not change. The existing
catalog `category` / `categories` and issue `status_category` response fields
retain the seven-value wire enum accepted by installed clients. Built-ins emit
their fixed key; custom statuses emit `todo`, `in_progress`, `done`, or
`cancelled` as a lifecycle encoding. New clients normalize those fields into
four categories. This is one API-boundary adapter, not a second stored model
or behavior mapping. Old category inputs are accepted on catalog creation,
reordering and category filters, and normalized to the new lifecycle.

This prevents enum changes from breaking ordinary reads and writes after the
backend upgrade. It does not promise identical old UI grouping or old agent
instructions: old filters can broaden when categories combine, old saved
grouping views can require refresh/upgrade, and old daemons cannot render the
new lifecycle brief reliably. Update clients/daemons for the new feature.
Board/List/Swimlane status grouping uses concrete keys, with independent custom
columns, counts and cursors. Hidden/collapsed preferences preserve exact keys;
old category-named storage is read on load without merging sibling statuses.
New snapshots persist `hiddenStatuses`; exact status filters are unchanged.
Deploy the backend before clients: custom Swimlane columns require the compound
`secondary: status` API to accept workspace-scoped custom keys.
Validation errors (unknown/archived status, permissions, stale reorder sets)
still return their normal error responses; no API guarantees every request
will succeed, especially during the accepted mixed-version window.

## Regression coverage

- Actual 332-to-469 migration and replay against an isolated transactional
  schema; non-category field preservation and SQL tenant isolation.
- Built-in identity, custom lifecycle vs special behavior, unknown-key handling,
  archived status reads, category filtering, table/swimlane grouping.
- Old/current category inputs and legacy response encoding, including realtime
  issue payloads; frontend normalization and mobile lifecycle parity.
- Backlog-to-custom-Unstarted promotion and no custom-to-Todo re-promotion;
  catalog locks, access checks, reorder atomicity, fixed built-in protection.
- Agent brief and bundled skill assertions enforce the new semantics.
