/**
 * RichCodeBlock — the ONLY fenced-code dispatcher in the product (MUL-4922).
 *
 * Every product surface (Chat, Issue description, Comment) reaches fenced code
 * through this file. Adding a language branch anywhere else — a per-surface
 * `if (lang === "…")` in a message list or a comment card — is exactly the
 * drift this sweep deleted, so new languages get added HERE and nowhere else.
 *
 * Dispatch is on a whole language token, never a substring: `language-htmlbars`
 * and `language-mermaidx` are ordinary code, not an HTML preview / diagram.
 *
 * Upgrading to a rich block additionally requires the fence to be CLOSED (see
 * streaming-fence.ts). A half-streamed fence renders as plain source, so
 * Mermaid never parses a partial diagram and no iframe is created for HTML that
 * is still arriving.
 *
 * Upgraded fences render as dynamic blocks (MermaidBlock / HtmlBlockPreview):
 * one frame with an always-visible title bar, content height and in-place
 * loading and error states (MUL-7649). The frame and its leaves live in
 * `editor/` next to the Tiptap NodeViews that share the leaves. They are
 * imported by direct path — never through the `editor` barrel — so this module
 * does not pull the editor's Tiptap graph into Chat.
