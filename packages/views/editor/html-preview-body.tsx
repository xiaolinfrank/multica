/**
 * HtmlPreviewBody — an HTML document in the sandboxed preview iframe, for the
 * attachment viewer's html kind (the caller has already fetched the text).
 *
 * Owns the three things every HTML attachment preview needs:
 *
 *   - srcDoc + sandbox="allow-scripts" via CodeBlockIframe
 *   - withFragmentNavShim() so anchor links inside the iframe scroll instead
 *     of silently failing in the sandbox's opaque origin
 *   - the address bridge, so the document loads at the address bar's
 *     address (`location`, owned by the stage — useHtmlPreviewLocation)
 *
 * A ```html block in a message body is a dynamic block instead
 * (html-block-preview.tsx): it adds theme tokens and a size/error bridge.
