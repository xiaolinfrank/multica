// RuntimeLookup is how production code reads agent_runtime rows by id
// (MUL-6884) — one row via Get, or many in one query via GetMany. Every read
// that resolves a runtime for a product behaviour goes through it, so
// multica_agent_runtime_lookup_total can attribute that behaviour.
//
// One reader is deliberately outside it: the agent-list presence projection
// (handler.loadAgentRuntimeAvailability) batch-reads runtime rows to derive a
// coarse liveness bucket for agents whose runtime the viewer may not see. It
// resolves rows for agents rather than resolving a runtime a caller asked for,
// and it is unclassified rather than counted as some existing source, because
// folding it into one would make that source's rate stop meaning what its name
// says. Classifying it is worth doing; it needs its own source constant and is
// not part of MUL-6788.
//
// Point-read callers share one SQL fingerprint, while GetMany uses a separate
// batch-query fingerprint. pg_stat_statements can show that either query is
// busy, but not whether daemon heartbeats, browser polling loops, or readiness
// gates are driving it. Routing both query shapes through one type, carrying
// the source with each lookup, makes that question answerable before anyone
// starts changing heartbeat intervals.
//
// Source is a closed enum from the metrics package (obsmetrics.RuntimeLookupSource*).
// Metrics may be nil — tests and self-hosted deployments without the metrics
// listener run without it, and the counter is best-effort by construction.

// per-source attribution GetAgentRuntime callers get, without issuing N point
// reads (MUL-6788). It returns the rows keyed by their canonical UUID string
// so a differently-cased request id still resolves.
//
// Metric accounting mirrors N individual Get calls: a batch read error counts
// one "error" per requested id (the whole lookup failed for each), and on
// success each id is counted "ok" when its row came back and "not_found" when
// it did not — so multica_agent_runtime_lookup_total keeps the same shape it
// had before batching. The read error is returned untouched so callers can fail
// closed instead of treating a hiccup as "every runtime is gone".
