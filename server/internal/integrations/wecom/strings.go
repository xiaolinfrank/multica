package wecom

// strings.go — every string a WeCom user reads, in one place, selected per
// READER.
//
// The copy used to sit inline wherever it was sent: the offline and archived
// notices in replier.go, the binding prompt built by hand a few lines below
// them, the inbox card's type labels in inbox_message.go. All of it Chinese,
// which is right for our own tenant and wrong the moment anyone else installs
// the bot — and impossible to find, because "what does this bot say" was
// spread across three files.
//
// Which pack a given message uses is decided by the DESTINATION, not by the
// installation (language.go): a 1:1 gets that person's Multica profile
// language, and a room — where there is no shared profile and no member list —
// gets the deployment's own language.
//
// Slack's adapter hardcodes English and Lark's hardcodes Chinese, so there is
// no house i18n mechanism to join. This is deliberately not one either: a
// struct of strings per locale. No catalogue files, no message ids, no plural
// rules. If wecom ever needs a third language with real formatting rules,
// that is the moment to reach for a framework — not now.
//
// The zh-Hans pack is the text this adapter was already sending, character for
// character. Nothing a Chinese tenant reads changes here; the English pack is
// new.

// is a room, or a person whose profile says nothing. Set once at boot from
// MULTICA_WECOM_DEFAULT_LOCALE (cmd/server/router.go) and read on every
// message, so it is an atomic rather than a plain var: -race would otherwise
// flag the boot write against the first inbound frame.
//
// It exists because the alternative answers are all worse. A hardcoded
// constant makes an English-speaking tenant's rooms Chinese with no way out
// but a rebuild. An installation-level column was tried and removed: nothing
// could write it. Borrowing the installer's personal profile language repeats,
// with a different person, the exact bug that motivated this — one member's
// setting deciding what a whole room reads. A deployment-level knob is the

//
// Deliberately NOT resolveLocale. That one reads a user's profile field, which
// the API has already validated to en / zh-Hans / ko / ja, so it can treat
// "anything that isn't Chinese" as a deliberate choice of the English pack. An
// env var has been validated by nobody: under that rule
// MULTICA_WECOM_DEFAULT_LOCALE=zh_Hant, or a stray quote, would quietly put a
// Chinese tenant's rooms into English. So this one matches exactly, and an
// operator who mistypes gets the old language and a log line, not a surprise.
