// dedupe_redis.go — the at-most-once claim behind a routed delivery.
//
// It lives on the same Redis the relay itself runs on, which is the whole
// reason this is not a new dependency: no Redis means no relay, which means no
// cross-replica routing and nothing to deduplicate. A deployment that never
// needed Redis is not asked for it now.
//
// One key per turn, keyed on the same event id the stream entry carries, so a
// frame replayed after a restart and a frame read by two replicas
// mid-lease-move meet the same key. The value is the owner's token while the
// delivery is in flight, then "settled" (its holder recorded the outcome) or
// "lost" (the publisher did).
